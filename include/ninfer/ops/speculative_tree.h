/**
 * One verification row's draft tree, built on the device every round by candidate_selector_tree
 * and read by the tree forms of the verification Ops below and of attention, GDN and acceptance.
 *
 * Columns 0..nodes-1 of the row are live. Column 0 is the anchor. Every other column c has
 * parent[c] < c, depth[c] = depth[parent[c]] + 1 and holds one proposed token. Columns
 * 0..main_depth form the main chain (parent[c] = c-1, the chain proposal) and every other column
 * lies after it at a depth of at most main_depth. Children are linked in draw order through
 * first_child/next_sibling (-1 terminates); a main column's main-chain child is its first child,
 * and sibling_index is a column's position among its siblings.
 *
 * paths lists every root-to-leaf column sequence in increasing leaf column order, so the main
 * chain is path 0. A column belongs to the first path that contains it: path p owns
 * path_columns[p][owned_from[p] .. path_length[p]-1].
 *
 * tree is 0 for a chain row (a row of a tree round whose extent is below the tree's: its live
 * columns are its chain prefix and no other column is used) and 1 for a tree row.
